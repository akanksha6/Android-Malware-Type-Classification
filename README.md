The widespread use of Android smartphones has led to a rise in malicious applications. Existing methods for detecting malware often struggle to keep up with the continually evolving landscape of threats. This study investigates the effectiveness of utilizing machine learning (ML) techniques to classify Android malware across multiple categories. We assess seven different ML models, including ensemble learning algorithms like Random Forest and XGBoost, as well as a deep learning architecture known as CNN-LSTM. This evaluation involves a comprehensive dataset of 18,998 Android APKs categorized into five distinct classes: adware, banking malware, SMS malware, riskware, and benign applications. 

To handle data imbalance, we employ feature selection and SMOTE oversampling techniques.

Our thorough analysis reveals that ensemble learning methods, particularly Random Forest and XGBoost, achieve impressive performance, surpassing 90% accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score across all malware categories. The deep learning model (CNN-LSTM) also shows promising results, indicating its potential for further improvement. 

These findings highlight the efficacy of ensemble learning and deep learning approaches in addressing the complex challenge of classifying multiclass Android malware. Future research directions may involve exploring alternative classification strategies, incorporating contemporary datasets, and optimizing model hyperparameters for improved adaptability and reliability.
